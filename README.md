# NNWorkshop
 Materials for "Neural Networks In Cognitive Development" workshop taught as part of PSY6003A at UEA

These Jupyter worksheets are materials for a 2-week practical workshop that is part of the 3rd year Psychology module "Developmental Science in Action" at UEA
and requires no experience with coding or Python. These practical sessions follow corresponding lectures about the history of neural networks in general
and their role in modelling cognition.
They introduce simple perceptrons to solve logical AND, and simulations to model past tense acquisition in English using backpropagation.
The aim is to discover, through short modelling exercises, the role of computational modelling and simulations of learning in our understanding of mechanims of cognitive development.
The code was developed and adapted from https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-perceptron-algorithm-scratch-python/
